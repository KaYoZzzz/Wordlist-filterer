# Wordlist-filterer
A wordlist filterer developed with java.
This wordlist filterer application in Java is a useful tool for creating a new wordlist from an existing one by applying string length criteria. This application allows you to: 
-Select a wordlist to filter by choosing the file from a dialog box. 
-Select a destination folder for the newly generated wordlist, choosing the folder from a dialog box. 
-Enter the minimum number of characters a word must have to be included in the new wordlist, by typing a positive integer value. 
-Enter the maximum number of characters a word must have to be included in the new wordlist, typing a positive integer value greater than or equal to the minimum. 

The application reads the original wordlist and filters out strings that do not meet the length criteria, creating a new wordlist with only acceptable strings. 
The new wordlist is saved in the destination folder with the name "output.txt" This wordlist filterer application in Java is easy to use and can be useful for those who need to create a custom wordlist for different purposes, such as password cracking, pentesting, web scraping, etc.
